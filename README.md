# Stisla Laravel
Stisla is the most-awesome admin panel I've seen so far. As I love this template very much, I have implemented Stisla in a fresh Laravel 8.5 app. Simply clone this repo and start building your next Laravel project on top of the awesome Stisla. If you want to make it more dynamic, you can update the pages or add your own.

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gekikara38/laravel-stisla
```

Install composer packages:
```shell
composer update
```

Copy and rename .env.example to .env:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

update the environmental variables and set an app key:
```shell
php artisan key:generate
```
